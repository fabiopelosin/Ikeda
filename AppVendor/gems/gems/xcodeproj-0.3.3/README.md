Xcodeproj lets you create and modify Xcode projects from [Ruby][ruby].
Script boring management tasks or build Xcode-friendly libraries. Also includes
support for Xcode workspaces (.xcworkspace) and configuration files (.xcconfig).

It is used in [CocoaPods](https://github.com/cocoapods/cocoapods) to create a
static library from scratch, for both iOS and OSX.


## Installing Xcodeproj

Xcodeproj itself installs through RubyGems, the Ruby package manager. Install it
by performing the following command:

    $ [sudo] gem install xcodeproj --pre


## Colaborate

All Xcodeproj development happens on [GitHub][xcodeproj]. Contributing patches
is really easy and gratifying. You even get push access when one of your patches
is accepted.

Follow [@CocoaPodsOrg][twitter] to get up to date information about what's
going on in the CocoaPods world.

If you're really oldschool and you want to discuss Xcodeproj development you
can join #cocoapods on irc.freenode.net.
